# ezy7

ezy7 allows you to easily install BasiliskII without the hiccups, the complex configs, ROMs, and more. 

This script installs a BasiliskII directory placed in the directory of your choice. This directory contains:
```
BasiliskII.app
Disks
...MacOS7.dsk
...MacHD.dsk
ROMs
...MacIIci.ROM
Shared
```


> ***Note on ROMs***
> 
> You can get more ROMs under the ROMs directory of this repo.
>
> Some of these ROMs have their each pros and cons, but the MacIIci ROM was chosen at installation because it is a pretty solid choice.
>
> ***Note on Disks/MacHD.dsk***
>
> This MacHD.dsk file is a blank disk that is 800MB for the alternative installation install of MacOS 7 instead of booting it on the system floppy image.
